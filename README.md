# CSS-Flag-Project
Hello, This is Aryan. 
This is a basic project to practice CSS concepts.
In this project, I have used CSS concepts such as combining CSS selectors, CSS cascade, Margin, Padding and Border and CSS Positioning (Relative & Absolute).
Anybody who is currently learning, HTML, CSS and want to practice the concepts, then projects are the best way to do the same.
If you want to practice too, then follow the below steps:-
1. First Look at goal.png
2. According to that type your CSS and HTML code.
3. If you were successful in achieving the goal, then its good otherwise look at my codes and solve your doubts and practice again.
